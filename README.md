# Autonomous Ride-Sharing Network

## Description
This project implements an Autonomous Ride-Sharing Network managed by autonomous agents. These agents represent drivers and passengers, negotiate fares, schedule rides, and optimize routes. The project leverages `uAgents` for agent representation, `Fetch.ai` for secure payment processing and transaction logging, and `Agentverse` to simulate traffic patterns and optimize ride distribution.
